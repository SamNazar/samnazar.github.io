Hi.  I'm a software engineer raised in the Washington, DC area and currently based in Los Angeles.  My first experiences with programming were with QBASIC and Turbo Pascal.  The endless possibilities and power of software had me hooked immediately.  In my professional career, I've primarily been a full-stack Web Developer.  I have worked most extensively with Java, C# / ASP.NET, SQL, JavaScript, and (most recently) Python.

When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy photography, racquetball, playing the guitar, being outdoors, and learning new things.  I am also a fan of board games, and occasionally take part in [board game jams](http://laboardgamejam.com/).
